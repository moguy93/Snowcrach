UID 2013 started us but we we expect 4242

level13@SnowCrash:~$ id
uid=2013(level13) gid=2013(level13) groups=2013(level13),100(users)

So it check my uid and compare it to 4242.
We will use gdb to change the value of my uid before it is compared to 4242. The uid indicating the user it isn’t possible to change it otherwise.

level13@SnowCrash:~$ gdb level13

My uid is stocked in the variable eax.

I pose some breakpoint. And then change the value of the variable eax before it was compared to 4242.
